A movie finding and suggestion app that hooks into local cinema listings.

__Note__: Android SDK Tools 25.3.1 dropped support for the `android` binary release, and subsequently moved the resulting Gradle build wrapper that Cordova uses. As such, until Cordova 7.x is released, an updated and explicit installation of the updated android platform is required.
